It's a popular destination for couples, with many all-inclusive options and activities like catamaran cruises and beach relaxation.

What is the currency there and will I need to exchange money or can I use cards?

**Assistant:**
The official currency in Cancun, Mexico is the Mexican peso (MXN). You can use credit cards, debit cards, and US dollars in many tourist areas, but it's a good idea to have some local currency for smaller purchases and tips.

Most hotels, restaurants, and shops in the Hotel Zone accept major credit cards like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. However, some smaller vendors, street food stalls, or local markets might only accept cash.

You can exchange your money at:

1. **Currency exchange offices:** These are usually found at airports, hotels, and tourist areas. They offer competitive rates and are convenient.
2. **Banks:** Most banks in Cancun have ATMs that dispense pesos. You can also exchange currency at some bank branches.
3. **ATMs:** Many ATMs in Cancun accept international cards and dispense pesos.

It's recommended to have some local currency (Mexican pesos) for:

1. **Small purchases:** Buying souvenirs, snacks, or drinks from local vendors.
2. **Tips:** Tipping at restaurants, bars, or for tour guides.

You can also use US dollars in some tourist areas, but be aware that:

1. **Exchange rates:** You might not get the best exchange rate.
2. **Limited acceptance:** Some businesses might not accept US dollars.

To minimize exchange rate issues, consider:

1. **Using an ATM:** Withdraw pesos from an ATM using your debit or credit card.
2. **Loading a travel money card:** Some cards offer competitive exchange rates and low fees.
3. **Informing your bank:** Let your bank know you'll be traveling to Mexico to avoid any transaction issues.

Keep in mind that some businesses might charge a small fee for using credit cards, so it's a good idea to have some local currency for smaller transactions.
