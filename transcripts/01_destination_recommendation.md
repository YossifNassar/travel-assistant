For a warm beach vacation in March with a moderate budget for a couple, consider the following destinations:

You can find all-inclusive resorts, which can help with budgeting. Activities include snorkeling, visiting ancient Mayan ruins, and exploring the hotel zone.
* **Punta Cana, Dominican Republic**: Punta Cana is known for its pristine beaches, golf courses, and luxury resorts. March is a great time to visit, with warm weather (average high of 78°F/25°C) and low humidity. Many resorts offer all-inclusive packages, and activities include snorkeling, hiking, and catamaran cruises.
* **Barbados**: Barbados offers a mix of relaxation and culture, with stunning beaches, historic sites, and vibrant nightlife. March is a great time to visit, with warm weather (average high of 78°F/25°C) and minimal rainfall. Explore Harrison's Cave, visit the historic town of Bridgetown, and enjoy the island's famous cuisine.
* **Costa Rica**: Costa Rica offers a more laid-back, eco-friendly beach vacation. March is a great time to visit, with warm weather (average high of 77°F/25°C) and minimal rainfall. You can explore the Pacific coast, visit national parks, and enjoy activities like surfing, ziplining, or relaxing in a beach town like Tamarindo.

These destinations offer a range of options for accommodations, dining, and activities, and can fit a moderate budget for a couple.

**User:**
Cancun sounds great! How much is 1 USD in Mexican pesos right now?

**Assistant:**
As of the current exchange rate, 1 USD is approximately 17.22 MXN. This can help you plan your expenses and budget for your trip to Cancun. Keep in mind that exchange rates can fluctuate, so it's always a good idea to check the current rate before your trip or use an ATM to withdraw local currency once you arrive.

**User:**
Are there any public holidays in Mexico in March?

**Assistant:**
In March, Mexico celebrates Benito Juárez's birthday on March 17th. However, this is not typically a day when businesses or tourist attractions close.

It's worth noting that Easter (Semana Santa) can occur in March or April, and it can affect tourist areas and business hours. If you're planning to visit during Easter week, it's a good idea to check with your hotel or tour operators for any changes in schedules or closures.

Keep in mind that these dates can vary from year to year, but for 2025, March 17th is the only public holiday.
