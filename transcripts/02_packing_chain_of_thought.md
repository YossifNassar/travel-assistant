## Public Holidays in Japan in April

In Japan, April has a few significant holidays. Here's what you should know:

### Showa Day (昭和の日, Shōwa no Hi)

- **Date**: April 29th
- **Significance**: This holiday commemorates the birthday of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito), who reigned from 1926 to 1989. It's a day to reflect on the post-war period and the era of Shōwa.

### Golden Week (ゴールデンウィーク, Gōruden Wīku)

Following Showa Day, Japan has a week-long holiday period known as Golden Week, which includes several national holidays:

- **April 29th (Shōwa Day)**: As mentioned
