* T-shirts and light pants for warmer afternoons (high of 10.91°C)
* Comfortable walking shoes or sneakers

* Warm layers for indoor spaces or cooler days (it can get chilly in buildings with air conditioning)

**Toiletries:**

* Toothbrush, toothpaste, and dental floss
* Deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash
* Razor and shaving cream (if applicable)

**User:**
We are also planning to visit some temples and do a lot of walking. Should I add anything else to the list?

**Assistant:**
Given your plans to visit temples and do a lot of walking, I'd recommend adding a few more items to your packing list:

**Additional Clothing:**

* Modest clothing for temple visits (e.g., long pants, sleeves that cover your shoulders)
* Comfortable socks for walking (consider bringing a few extra pairs in case some get wet or sweaty)
* Scarf or shawl for added warmth or modesty

**Footwear:**

* Good quality walking shoes or hiking boots with sturdy soles and ankle support
* Sandals or flip-flops with a good grip for warmer days or temple visits

**Temple Visit Essentials:**

* Small bag or backpack for carrying essentials like water, snacks, and a map
* Camera with a respectful lens (no selfie sticks or large cameras might be allowed in some temples)
* Small donations or offerings (e.g., coins, incense sticks) for temple visits

**Walking Accessories:**

* Walking stick or trekking pole (optional, but helpful for longer walks)
* Comfortable walking accessories like shoe horns, lacing aids, or toe protectors

**Other:**

* Portable charger for your phone or camera (you'll likely be taking a lot of photos)
* Water bottle and refillable container for snacks

Remember to check the specific dress code and rules for each temple you plan to visit, as some may have more stringent requirements than others.

**User:**
What about currency and language in Japan? Will I need cash?

**Assistant:**
In Japan, the official currency is the Japanese yen (JPY). While some places, especially larger cities like Tokyo, may accept credit cards, it's still a predominantly cash-based society. You'll likely need a combination of cash and cards.

**Cash:**

* Japanese yen (¥) is the local currency
* You can exchange your money at airports, banks, or currency exchange machines
* ATMs are widely available, but some may not accept foreign cards

**Credit Cards:**

* Major credit cards like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are widely accepted in larger cities
* However, smaller shops, restaurants, and traditional markets might only accept cash
* Inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any transactions being flagged as suspicious

**Language:**

* The official language is Japanese
* English is not widely spoken, especially outside of larger cities and tourist areas
* Consider learning basic Japanese phrases like "konnichiwa" for "hello," "arigatou" for "thank you," and "sumimasen" for "excuse me"

**Tips:**

* Have some local currency (yen) with you when you arrive
* Use ATMs to withdraw cash as needed
* Inform your bank and credit card providers of your travel plans
* Consider purchasing a Suica or Pasmo card for easy travel on public transportation

I hope this helps you prepare for your trip to Japan!
